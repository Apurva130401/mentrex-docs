# Frequently Asked Questions

### Is Mentrex free?
Mentrex offers a free tier for new users to try the capabilities. Heavy usage requires purchasing credits.

### Does Mentrex read all my files?
No. Mentrex runs locally on your machine. It only reads the files necessary to answer your current question or task. We do not train models on your private code.

### Can I use I offline?
The CLI commands like `help` work offline, but generating code (`create`) requires an internet connection to reach our AI brain.

### Why does the AI asking for permission so much?
Security! We believe you should always be in control. You can enable "Auto-Approve" in settings if you trust the agent for certain tasks.

*   **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**: Best balance of coding speed and accuracy. (Default)
*   **GPT-4o**: Excellent for general reasoning.
