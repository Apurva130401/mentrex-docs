# Frequently Asked Questions

### Is Mentrex free?
Mentrex is fully free to use. You maintain complete control over your usage and billing by bringing your own API keys. We believe users should have full autonomy over their credit consumption and provider choices.
    
### What upcoming features are planned?
We are actively developing a credit-based system to power advanced capabilities, including an App Builder, Workflow Maker, and Visual Coding tools. Stay tuned for these premium enhancements!

### Does Mentrex read all my files?
No. Mentrex runs locally on your machine. It only reads the files necessary to answer your current question or task. We do not train models on your private code.

### Can I use I offline?
The CLI commands like `help` work offline, but generating code (`create`) requires an internet connection to reach our AI brain.

### Why does the AI asking for permission so much?
Security! We believe you should always be in control. You can enable "Auto-Approve" in settings if you trust the agent for certain tasks.

### Which model is the best?
*   **Claude 4.5 Opus**: Best balance of coding speed and accuracy. (Default)
*   **GPT-5.1**: Excellent for general reasoning.
*   **DeepSeek**: Great for C++ and low-level optimization.
