# Account & Credits

## API Keys
Your API Key is your "Passport" to the Mentrex ecosystem. 
*   **Treat it like a password.** Do not share it or commit it to public GitHub repositories.
*   **Generation**: You can generate multiple keys in the [Dashboard](https://app.mentrex.shop/dashboard/keys) (e.g., one for your laptop, one for a server).
*   **Revocation**: If a key is compromised, delete it immediately in the dashboard.

## Credits System
Mentrex creates code by using large language models (LLMs) which have a computation cost.

*   **How it works**: You purchase credits, and they are deducted as you verify prompts and generate code.
*   **Cost Efficiency**: 
    *   User `gpt-3.5` or smaller models for simple tasks (cheaper).
    *   Use `gpt-4o` or `claude-3-opus` for complex architecture (more expensive but smarter).
*   **Checking Balance**:
    *   **In VS Code**: displayed in the settings or sidebar footer.
    *   **In CLI**: Run `mentrex balance`.

## Billing
*   **Top Up**: buying more credits is instant via the Dashboard.
*   **History**: You can view your complete usage history and invoices in the "Billing" tab.
